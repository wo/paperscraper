Fall 2007 Course Announcements




 	
Math 1A - Section 1 - Calculus
Instructor: Paul Vojta
Lectures: MWF 2:00-3:00pm, Room 10 Evans
Course Control Number: 54103
Office: 883 Evans
Office Hours: TBD
Prerequisites: Three and one-half years of high school math, including trigonometry and analytic geometry, plus a satisfactory grade in one of the following: CEEB MAT test, an AP test, the UC/CSU math diagnostic test, or Math 32. Consult the mathematics department for details. Students with AP credit should consider choosing a course more advanced than 1A.
Required Text: Stewart, Single Variable Essential Calculus - Early Transcendentals (custom edition for UCB), Brooks/Cole
Note: This is not the same as Calculus - Early Transcendentals, which is being used for Math 1B and was used for Math 1A last semester and during the summer.  If a book is the fifth or sixth edition of something, then it is the wrong book.
For Math 1A, you can use the regular edition of Essential Calculus, Early Transcendentals (note the title change), since the early chapters of the custom edition are the same as the early chapters of the standard edition.  However, the custom edition adds material on differential equations used in Math 1B, so the standard edition would not be suitable for students planning to continue on to Math 1B.
Recommended Reading: None
Syllabus: A paper copy will be distributed on the first day of class; it will also be available on the course web page shortly before classes begin.
Course Webpage: http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/1a.html
Grading: Grading will be based on a first midterm (10%), a second midterm (20%), the final exam (45%), and a component stemming from the discussion sections (25%). This latter component is left to the discretion of the section leader, but it is likely to be determined primarily by homework assignments and biweekly quizzes.  See more details, below.
Homework: Homework will consist of weekly assignments, given on the syllabus.  Information on solutions will be available on the syllabus.
Comments: This is the first semester of the year-long calculus sequence; this particular course is intended primarily for majors in engineering and the physical sciences. This semester&#39;s topics will include differentiation, transcendental functions, and integration. A detailed syllabus will be passed out during the first week of class.

Prerequisites: 
Required Text: 
Recommended Reading:
Syllabus: The main topics in Math 54 are linear algebra and differential equations.  We begin by studying how  matrix algebra can be used  to solve systems of linear equations.  Then we see how to interpet these algebraic techniques geometrically in a more general and abstract context. This allows us to apply  linear algebra to the theory of differential equations,  one of its most important applications.  An important goal of this course is to illustrate the interplay between algebra and geometry and between abstraction and applications.
Course Webpage: http://math.berkeley.edu/~ogus/Math_54-07/index.html
Grading: Grading will be based on the two miderms, final, and nearly daily quizzes (which will closely match the homework).

Office: 867 Evans
Office Hours: TuTh 5:00-6:00pm
Prerequisites:  
Required Text: Walter Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis
Recommended Reading: 
Syllabus: Real and complex numbers, basic topology, sequences and series, continuity, differentiation, integration, sequences and series of functions, linear algebra, Fourier series and integrals.
Course Webpage: http://math.berkeley.edu/~shamgar/104F07.html
Grading: There will be weekly assignments which will be due in one week, a midterm exam and a final. They will count toward the grade as follows:
 
Assignments 30% 
Midterm 30% 
Final 40%
Attitude: In our course we will study some basics of analysis. The attitude will be to help you to develop your way on how to think about some mathematical objects that you will encounter during your undergraduate studies. Moreover, I expect you to be an integral part of the course, i.e., to attend lectures, to participate in the discussions, to submit homework, and to visit me during my office hours. 
What: We intend to cover all the basic material so we can understand why a nice function on the circle can be written as a linear combination of exponential functions en(x) = e2&#960;inx, n &#8712; Z.  In particular I hope to formulate, explain and prove the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.

Course Webpage: 
Grading: The grade will be based on your homework (25%), two midterms (20% and 20%) and a final (35%). The first midterm will take place pretty early, at the end of the third week of classes.
Homework: There will be a weekly homework assignment, with problems from the book.
Comments: This class is designed for students in the physical sciences and engineering who need to go from a lower division mathematical foundation into a more advanced level and cannot take a series of classes where this material is introduced at a slower and more detailed pace.

The book does a very good job at covering a large amount of basic material that will be useful in a variety of science and engineering classes.

Office Hours: M 11:00am-12:30pm, W 12:00-1:30pm, and by appointment
Prerequisites: Math 113, or some equivalent experience with abstract mathematics (definitions, theorems, and proofs).
Required Text: H. Enderton, A mathematical introduction to logic, Academic Press, 2nd edition.
Recommended Reading:
Syllabus: 
 Introduction. General description of the material to be covered, and especially of the Completeness theorem for first order logic, which is our main target. Background material from elementary set theory. Countable and uncountable sets. Approximately 1.5 weeks. 

Chapter 1. Sentential logic. Approximately 4 weeks. We shall omit 1.6.

 Chapter 2. First order logic. Approximately 9 weeks. We shall cover all of this chapter except perhaps section 2.8. My lectures will expand the material in sections 2.2 and 2.6 fairly substantially. We will also cover the material in a slightly different order than the book does, in that we will cover most of 2.6 before we cover 2.4 and 2.5.

 
There will be two midterms, the first in early October , after we have covered chapter 1, and the second in November, after we have covered 2.0-2.3 and 2.6. I will announce the exact date for each midterm at least 2 weeks in advance of it. 
Course Webpage: Course information and homework assignments will be available online at http://math.berkeley.edu/~steel/courses/Courses.html
Grading: There will be two midterms and a final. Each midterm is worth 20%, and the final exam is worth 40%. Homework accounts for the remaining 20%. 
Homework: Homework will be assigned weekly. The assignments will announced at lecture on Tuesdays, and posted on the web at http://math.berkeley.edu/~steel/courses/Courses.html. In general, homework will be due at lecture the Tuesday of the week following its assignment.
Comments: In my lectures I shall give the main definitions, examples, theorems, and proofs, along with what I hope will be intuitive explanations which glue them all together. This is a course in “real”, rigorous mathematics; students will be asked to know the exact statements of the main definitions and theorems, how to prove the main theorems, and to be able to find and present simpler proofs on their own. 

The main difficulty 125 presents to students is the abstraction and unfamiliarity of its basic concepts. Once you are at home with the basic concepts, it is not hard to prove the main theorems of the course. The difficulty is that these concepts, formal language, interpretation, truth, validity, definability, provability..., are pretty abstract, and not treated in other math courses you have had. Of course, as a thinking person, you have some intuitions as to what valid might mean. Such intuitions are useful, and you should try to build on them, but they are not a substitute for learning the mathematically rigorous definitions we shall give! 

One important way to deal with abstract concepts is to generate lots of examples on your own. Another is to make sure you have memorized all the main definitions, theorems, and proofs, in an exact form.

Office Hours: TBA
Prerequisites: Math 151, Math 113 or equivalent.
Required Text: None. Lecture notes will be made available as the course progresses.
Recommended Reading:
Syllabus: This is an upper division course in mathematics. Therefore, like any other upper division mathematics course, the emphasis will be on precision and reasoning (i.e., proofs). The goal is to present school mathematics as part of mathematics proper, so that when it is your turn to teach in the schools, you will be able to teach your students honest mathematics rather than the mess that one often witnesses in most school classrooms.

This course is the last part of a three-semester sequence, Math 151-152-153, whose purpose is to give a complete mathematical development of all the main topics of school mathematics in grades 8-12. A key feature of this presentation is that it would be directly applicable to the classroom of grades 8-12.

The topics to be covered include: The trigonometric functions and similar triangles; basic identities. Periodic functions. The real line and the least upper bound axiom. The concept of limit. Existence of n-th root. Area and volume: basic definitions and formulas. Second proof of the Pythagorean theorem. Basic concepts from calculus: continuity, convergence of infinite series, decimal representation of a real number. Derivative and integral. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; relationship with the concept of area and volume. Exponential and logarithmic functions and their basic properties. Proof of laws of exponents.

Homework: Weekly assignments, due every Wednesday.
Comments: Students are welcome to form study groups to work on the homework problems but not to copy from each other. The purpose of the problem session, every Wednesday 4-5 pm, is to discuss the solutions of the problems *after* the problem set has been handed in.

Math 191 - Section 1 - Seminar on Cryptography
Instructor: Kenneth A. Ribet
Lectures:  W 11:10am-12:30pm, Room 939 Evans
Course Control Number: 54955
Office: 885 Evans
Office Hours: To be announced
Prerequisites: Lower-division mathematics (including Math 53 and Math 54), and a keen interest in number theory and/or cryptography. Math 115 (even if taken concurrently) would be a big help.
Required Text: To be announced.  People claim that there is no clear winner in this area.
Syllabus: To some extent, this depends on the textbook. We want to discuss some of the standard crypto systems that depend on number theoretic issues for their security.  It is likely that we will talk about elliptic curves at some point.
Course Webpage: http://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/191/; this is left over from a similar course that I taught long ago, but will be re-built for the fall.
Grading: P/NP; everyone signs up for 2 units of credit.
Homework: There will be some homework problems.  I hope that there will be a grader.
Comments: I&#39;m no expert in the subject, but I learned a lot the last time I taught a course like this.  I think that the book (by Buchmann) that we used last time is not optimal, so I&#39;m looking for something better. You might think that it would be a challenge to get telebears to agree that this course exists, but I know that it has been done, so go ahead and sign up if you&#39;d like to.



Math 202A - Section 1 - Introduction to Topology and Analysis
Instructor: Justin Holmer
Lectures: MWF 3:00-4:00pm, Room 10 Evans
Course Control Number: 54985
Office: 849 Evans
Office Hours: TBA
Prerequisites: An undergraduate "Intro. to Analysis" course (such as Math 104 here at Berkeley) with emphasis on writing rigorous mathematical proofs.  Specifically, must have mastery of basic set theory (including countability vs. uncountability), the logic of quantifiers, supremum/infimum of sets of real numbers, convergence/divergence of sequences and series of real numbers and the epsilon-N definition of limit, liminf and limsup, definitions of continuity and derivatives of functions and associated theorems, the definition and properties of the Riemann integral and the fundamental theorem of calculus, uniform versus pointwise convergence of sequences and series of functions and associated theorems on interchange of limit operations under hypothesis of uniformity.  Also, basic linear algebra (such as Math 110 here at Berkeley), especially concept of vector space, linear transformation, and matrix multiplication and diagonalization of hermitian matrices.
Required Text: None
Recommended Reading: Stein and Shakarchi, Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces. 
Royden, Real Analysis.
Munkres, Topology.

Stein and Shakarchi is reasonably priced and beautifully written.  It does not, however, cover the topology material.  Munkres covers topology alone and is a very clearly written text.  Royden is a standard text for this course and covers both topology and measure theory.  A detailed syllabus will be provided so you can study from any book of your choice.
Syllabus: During the first half of the course, we will cover general point-set topology and metric space theory.  During the second half of the course, we will cover the Lesbesgue measure and integration theory in Rd.  Math 202b in the spring will pick up on abstract measure and integration theory (includes the Lebesgue theory as a particular case, but also more exotic examples), and then launch into functional analysis: the study of Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, their generalizations, and linear mappings between these spaces.
Course Webpage: http://math.berkeley.edu/~holmer/teaching/f202a/
Grading: 50% homework, 50% final
Homework: Homework will be assigned once a week and due the following week, and will consist of about a dozen problems.  Plan to spend a full day preparing your solutions.  All problems, even if taken from a textbook, will be retyped and posted on the web.
Comments: This course is recommended for advanced undergraduate students planning to study math in graduate school, beginning graduate students who have not yet studied this material, or for students from other fields of science and engineering with the appropriate background and motivation.  If you are a full time student, plan to devote 1/4 of your time to this course.

Office Hours: TBA
Prerequisites: An introductory complex analysis course.  Mastery of basic real analysis and basic topology.
Required Text: No textbook will be followed closely.  The classic book of L. V. Ahlfors, "Complex Analysis," contains most of the course material.  Other possible references will be mentioned in the first lecture.
Recommended Reading:
Syllabus: Brief review centering on Cauchy&#39;s theorem and the argument principle; conformal mapping, including the Riemann mapping theorem and distortion theorems; analytic continuation; algebraic functions; entire functions and functions meromorphic in the entire plane, including the Weierstrass and Mittag-Leffler representations; elliptic functions; the modular function; Picard&#39;s theorems; Dirichlet series; Riemann zeta-function; prime number theorem.
Course Webpage:
Grading: The course grade will be based on homework.  There will be no exams.

Course Control Number: 54997
Office: 809 Evans
Office Hours: Tu 1:30-2:30pm, W 1:00-2:00pm (tentative)
Prerequisites: 202AB (graduate real analysis) and 185 (undergraduate complex analysis) or equivalents, and comfort with differential forms. In the second half of the semester, familiarity with the definitions of differentiable manifolds and vector bundles will be assumed. Some concepts and facts from algebra (concerning UFDs, quotient fields, modules over a ring, Noetherian rings, prime ideals) will crop up, but only superficial knowledge will be required.
Required Text: L. H&ouml;rmander, An Introduction to Complex Analysis in Several Variables (3rd edition)
Recommended Reading: Other useful alternative sources include: 
From Holomorphic Functions to Complex Manifolds by K. Fritzsche and H. Grauert. 
This book is recommended for additional reading on topics related to complex manifolds, and for a treatment with less emphasis on PDE, but is not in any sense required. It is not available through the bookstore. 
Krantz, Steven G. Function theory of several complex variables 
Range, R. Michael. Holomorphic functions and integral representations in several complex variables.
Syllabus: The course will be a general introduction to multivariable complex analysis, emphasizing scalar-valued holomorphic functions, pseudoconvexity and domains of holomorphy, plurisubharmonic functions and their applications, solution of the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations by the method of weighted L2 estimates, and Cousin problems. Coherent analytic sheaves will be introduced but not discussed in detail. The core of the course will be Chapters 2,4,5,6 of H&ouml;rmander’s text, plus an overview of Chapter 7. 

Partial differential equations methods will be a fundamental tool in the course, but merely a tool; the focus will be on their applications to function theory and complex geometry. All the background needed concerning PDE will be developed in the course. 

H&ouml;rmander’s text concisely treats the basics but cannot begin to survey all aspects of a large subject, so other sources will be placed on reserve in the math library for consultation.
Required Work: Problem sets will be distributed approximately every two weeks. There will be no examinations.

Recommended Reading:
Syllabus: I will teach a course in the basic theory of the representations of groups.  The main focus of the course will be on the case of finite groups.  We&#39;ll take a largely ring-theoretic approach - presenting the main theory of group representations as a case study of finitely generated modules over group rings. The course will begin with semisimple rings and the Artin-Wedderburn theorem, which the students should review ahead of time (from my ring theory textbook "First Course in Noncommutative Rings") if possible.

Math 256A - Section 1 - Algebraic Geometry
Instructor: Martin Olsson
Lectures: MWF 2:00-3:00pm, Room 81 Evans
Course Control Number: 55030
Office: 887 Evans
Office Hours: TBA
Prerequisites: A graduate-level course in abstract algebra.
Required Text: Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry, Springer Graduate Texts in Mathematics 52.
Recommended Reading:
Syllabus: This course together with its sequel Math 256B in the spring is an introduction to scheme theory and algebraic geometry in its modern formulation.  The one-year course will loosely follow Chapter II-V of Harshorne&#39;s Algebraic Geometry book, with some supplemental material from other sources.

The first semester I hope to cover the basic language of scheme theory and some curve theory.  The second semester will be focused on cohomology and surface theory.

Math 276 - Section 1 - Topics in Topology
Instructor: Peter Teichner
Lectures: TuTh 11:00am-12:30pm, Room 70 Evans (effective 9/13/07)
Course Control Number: 55039
Office: 703 Evans
Office Hours: Th 2:00-3:00pm
Prerequisites: Smooth manifolds and differential forms
Required Text: Relevant paper will be distributed in class.
Recommended Reading: Papers by Segal and Stolz-Teichner
Syllabus: We&#39;ll explain how to extend Graeme Segal&#39;s definition of a QFT over a manifold X in various directions, most significantly to super symmetric QFT&#39;s. We then show how these behave for d-dimensional space-time when d=0,1,2. It turns out that d=0 leads to closed differential forms on X, d=1 to interesting representatives for elements in K(X) and that 2-dimensional susy QFT&#39;s give integral modular forms. If time permits, we&#39;ll show how open-closed theories are related to locality for these (generalized) cohomology theories.

Comments: This is a brief outline of the course. It is likely that the course will go slower and that only part of this material will be covered.

 Classical and quantum mechanics in few lectures.
 The definition of classical and quantum field theories. Local classical field theories. Space-time categories. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches.
 Examples of classical field theories. Linear and non-linear field theories. Wess-Zumino-Witten (conformal) and Chern-Simons (topological) as main examples.
 Quantum field theories, the idea of a path integral. Topological quantum field theories, conformal QFT. Semiclassical limit and perturbation theory and finite type invariants of 3-manifolds.
 Axiomatic construction of topological quantum field theories from modular categories using surgery.
 Axiomatic construction of TQT based on a triangulation of 3-manifolds.
 Quantum conformal field theories in 2D and how they are related to modular categories. The relation between conformal and topological field theories.
 If time permits: more involved discussion of conformal field theory and gauge theories and how they are related to the representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.
