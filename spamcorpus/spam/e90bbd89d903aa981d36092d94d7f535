    Structural realism in the philosophy of physics
    
    Structural realism is a form of holism in the philosophy of physics, claiming that in the domain of fundamental physics, there are in the first place certain structures in the sense of networks of concrete physical relations instead of intrinsic properties. We develop a conception of moderate ontological structural realism that recognizes objects as that what stands in the relations, but those objects are characterized only by the relations in which they stand. We apply this conception to quantum physics and to space-time. We  currently investigate whether and in what sense these structures can be considered to be causal.

    Functional structures and conservative reductionism
    
    This project starts from three premises:
     1. The fundamental physical properties consist in structures
    2. All properties, including the fundamental physical structures, are causal
    3. Properties are modes, that is, the way objects are
     After providing independent arguments for each of these premises, we show how it is possible to construct a metaphysics of science on them that includes both fundamental physics and the special sciences. We argue that the properties that the special sciences consider are identical with local physical structures and we show how the multiple realization argument against reductionism can be countered by the introduction of functional sub-types.

    Direct realism in the philosophy of perception
    
    Direct realism is the claim that in perception we have a direct cognitive access to the physical environment. This position faces a strong challenge from the fact that perception is not always veridical. We seek to develop a reply to that challenge within a representational theory of the mind that fits into functionalism and structural realism.
