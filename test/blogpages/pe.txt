Yesterday the term ‘three black teenagers’ trended heavily on twitter. (see https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/09/three-black-teenagers-anger-as-google-image-search-shows-police-mugshots)
 The trend began when @iBeKabir tweeted the results of two Google 
searches. A search for three white teenagers turned up images of 
wholesome smiling white teenagers. A search for three black teenagers 
turned up images of mugshots. (Google images is already going meta over 
the story, with Google images now turning up images of three black 
teenagers contrasted with three white teenagers.)
There are a number of angles to this story worthy of reflection. For 
whatever reason, my thoughts about the story revolve around the 
difficulty of mustering empathy for people in different conditions than 
our own. The internet is full of whining and posturing about ‘identity 
politics.’ Often lost in the buzz surrounding such discussion are the 
basic facts that life in our society is much more difficult for some 
because of features of their identity, and that those lacking these 
features can find it very difficult to empathize.
Consider biking into the wind. It’s no fun. It’s hard, and the longer
 you go on the more effort each pedal takes. Conversely, biking with the
 wind is great. One interesting thing about biking with the wind is that
 you don’t actually feel the wind. You feel yourself as more powerful, 
with each pedal propelling you further than expected.
I suppose something similar is true for the privileged and the 
non-privileged in our society. Those who lack privilege due to features 
of their identity are, in certain respects, biking into the wind. Those 
with privilege due to features of their identity are, in certain 
respects, biking with the wind. Those without privilege are acutely 
conscious of the difficulties endemic to their position. Those with 
privilege can easily fail to notice the wind at all.
Often appropriate action towards and with others requires appropriate
 empathy. When those others are very other – very different from us in 
some respects – finding appropriate empathy can be difficult. Perhaps, 
recognizing this, we can also recognize a duty to work even harder to 
empathize with the very different.
